## Unique helm `charts`

> [!NOTE]
> Uniques charts are now open source and available both as OCI and Helm 3 artifacts. Check them out at [artifacthub.io](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?org=unique).

The charts left in here are custom, non-public helm charts that are used to deploy artifacts to the cluster.
