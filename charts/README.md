## Unique helm `charts`
It is discouraged to use these charts without a registry. They are added for convenience but only always as the latest version. It is recommended to use the `uniquecr.azurecr.io` registry as explained in the [Rollout Guidelines](https://unique-ch.atlassian.net/wiki/x/dQAoJQ). Unique won't keep versioned charts within this repository. If you need versioned charts, use a/the registry.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unique will never cache Open Source Charts that are required to run Unique FinanceGPT. These you must get from the official sources and either pull them from the official registry or cache them in your own registry.
