# Changelog `backend-service`

## [1.3.0] - 2024-10-23

### Added

- Supports `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1#HTTPRoute`s to accommodate for the next generation of Kubernetes Ingress, Load Balancing, and Service Mesh APIs.
  Refer to `.Values.httproute` for examples and instructions.
  ðŸ’¥ CRD's for `gateway.networking.k8s.io` must be present in the cluster in order for this to work.

Link the initContainer volume with the Deployment/Job/Cronjob containers

## [1.2.2]

## [1.2.0]
- Allow to configure tyk to ignore paths
    + Example
      ```
        ignorePaths:
          - methods:
            - GET
            path: /health
      ```

## [1.1.0]
- All workloads now support a new `envVars` list as part of the `values.yaml`
    + Compared to `env`, which is a flat map, this list allows for more complex environment variable definitions as the native Kubernetes Specs support them.
    + Example
      ```
      envVars:
      - name: NAME_OF_ENV
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            key: ENV_VALUE
            name: my-secret
      ```
