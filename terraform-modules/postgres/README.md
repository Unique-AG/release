# PostgreSQL Flexible Server

This Terraform code defines the configuration for a PostgreSQL Flexible Server in Azure. Let's break down the code section by section:

## Breakdown of the Code

1. **Locals:**
   - This section defines a local variable `default_parameters` which contains default configuration parameters for the PostgreSQL server. These include the maximum number of connections and the Azure extensions to be enabled.

2. **User Assigned Identity:**
   - This section creates a user-assigned managed identity for the PostgreSQL server. This identity will be used to access Azure Key Vault for secrets and to enable customer-managed keys.

3. **Private DNS Zone:**
   - This section creates a private DNS zone for the PostgreSQL server. This will allow the server to be accessed using a private FQDN within the virtual network.

4. **Private DNS Zone Virtual Network Link:**
   - This section creates a link between the private DNS zone and the virtual network where the PostgreSQL server will be deployed. This allows the server to resolve private DNS names within the virtual network.

5. **Key Vault Key:**
   - This section creates a key vault key in Azure Key Vault. This key will be used to encrypt and decrypt data stored in the PostgreSQL server.

6. **Random Passwords:**
   - This section generates random passwords for the PostgreSQL administrator username and password. These passwords will be stored in Azure Key Vault.

7. **PostgreSQL Flexible Server:**
   - This section defines the main PostgreSQL Flexible Server configuration.
     - The server name is based on the module context's full name.
     - It's deployed in the same location and resource group as the other resources.
     - The server version is specified by the `flex_pg_version` variable.
     - The delegated subnet ID is specified by the `delegated_subnet_id` variable.
     - The administrator login and password are set using the generated random passwords.
     - The private DNS zone ID is set to the ID of the private DNS zone created earlier.
     - Public network access is disabled.
     - The SKU name and storage size are specified by the `flex_sku` and `flex_storage_mb` variables respectively.
     - Customer-managed key is enabled using the key vault key ID and the user-assigned identity ID.
     - A user-assigned managed identity is attached to the server for authentication.
     - The server depends on the private DNS zone virtual network link and the key vault key.
     - Tags are inherited from the module context.
     - The `zone` attribute is ignored in the lifecycle block to prevent unnecessary changes.

8. **Key Vault Secrets:**
   - This section creates four secrets in Azure Key Vault:
     - `host`: Stores the FQDN of the PostgreSQL server.
     - `port`: Stores the port number of the PostgreSQL server.
     - `username`: Stores the administrator username for the PostgreSQL server.
     - `password`: Stores the administrator password for the PostgreSQL server.

9. **PostgreSQL Flexible Server Configuration:**
   - This section configures the PostgreSQL server with the parameters defined in the `default_parameters` local variable and the `parameters` variable.

10. **Monitor Diagnostic Setting:**
    - This section creates a monitor diagnostic setting for the PostgreSQL server if a Log Analytics workspace ID is provided. This setting enables logging of various metrics and logs to the specified workspace.


## Conclusion

This Terraform code provides a comprehensive configuration for a PostgreSQL Flexible Server in Azure, including security, private networking, customer-managed keys, and monitoring. It demonstrates how Terraform can be used to manage and automate the deployment and configuration of PostgreSQL servers in a declarative way.
